        "Lately, AI and DS have gained traction because of recent innovations like intelligent voice assistants, self-driving cars, robotic process automation, and whatnot. All of this has taken the world by storm, and nowadays, everyone wants to learn more about these technologies.",
        "So, why should you learn AI? Because if you don\u2019t, you are likely to be a dinosaur in the world of technology by the end of 2021 \u2013 in the words of the American entrepreneur, Mark Cuban.",
        "Artificial Intelligence-based models need Data to train and operate properly. Thus, AI can also be understood as part of the Data Science discipline. So, yes, the path to learn AI passes by Data Science.",
        "Coding is needed for AI and machine learning, but \u201ca lot\u201d can be said in exaggeration. A significant number of incredibly complex machine learning models contain at maximum 2-3 lines of code. Again, the number of codes depends on the degree of development of a model. If a model is developed from scratch, then there are more codes. However, if a package is used, the number of codes is considerably smaller.",
        "There is a huge gap between the demand and supply of data scientists in India. This discrepancy is contributed by the lack of supply in data scientists and their rise in demand by various industries.",
        "Furthermore, the steep learning curve contributes to a sharp increase in the income bubble for Data Scientists.",
        "As a result, Data Scientists in India are earning more than their contemporary IT positions. A Data Scientist in India earns an average of \u20b9650,000 in a year.",
        "This is well above the national average for software engineers who make \u20b9450,000 per annum. Therefore, data scientists in India have more scope in the sense of their salaries and added privileges.",
