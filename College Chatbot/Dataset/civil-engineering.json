        "The demand for skilled Civil Engineers will never slow down worldwide as infrastructure projects, construction of building, and many more structures will keep on increasing and will never be stagnant.",
        "Civil Engineering is one of the major basic branches of engineering. The work ranges from basic concepts related to engineering to the overall development of the nation. A Civil Engineer is responsible for the Planning, Analysis, Designing, and Execution of all construction-related activities. It also includes Cost Estimation, Hydraulic Designs, Soil Engineering, Transportation, Environmental Issues, Surveying, etc. Civil Engineers are often expected to provide the best economic, efficient and eco-friendly designs to serve society inthe best possible ways. This ultimately results in the development of creative solutions to the existing problems in the designs that are designed differently without the budget constraints dictated by modern society. Nowadays, several cutting-edge technologies are available as a part of modern techniques in Civil Engineering to fulfill societal needs which also creates the scope for research and innovations.",
        "Civil Engineers shape the world we live in. They design, build and maintain the infrastructure we take for granted - every reservoir, dam, bridge, road, tunnel and building. Their expertise is key for sustainable future for all over the world.",
        "Civil Engineering is one of the oldest professional engineering disciplinesthat deal with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. It is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines including Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Structural Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Municipal or Urban Engineering, Water Resources Engineering, Materials Engineering, Coastal Engineering, Surveying, and Construction Engineering. Civil Engineering plays a predominant role in the Public as well as Private Sectors. In the Public Sector, Civil Engineering is required starting from the Municipal agency to the Central Government agencies. Similarly, in the Private sector, it is required from Individual Home Owners to International Companies.",
        "The Construction and Housing sector has become the major growth driver in the Indian Economy. The Civil Engineering department has started as the branch is gaining more importance due to the need of creating structures and buildings resisting earthquakes and other natural calamities. Civil Engineering Department was established in 2009. The department envisages creating world-class civil engineers. The department has highly qualified faculty members with research and industrial experience. The department is equipped with the required infrastructure and state-of-the-art laboratories",
        "If you study Civil Engineering at undergraduate level, you\u2019ll learn to apply mathematics and scientific knowledge (particularly physics) to real-life situations and problems that arise from creating and maintaining structures, taking into account environmental, financial, legal and ethical considerations.",
        "At its core, Civil Engineering is a combination of many scientific specialisms, including mechanics, hydraulics, geotechnics (using knowledge of the earth\u2019s crust to solve construction problems), material science and statistical analysis. As such, study of these foundational elements will feature heavily in the early years of civil engineering degrees.",
