        "The department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering was started in the year 2009 as one of the core engineering disciplines of the institute. The department offers a UG programme with a sanctioned intake of 60 students. Students have the choice of opting Hons with Specialization and Minor Degree. Currently, the department has also established a research centre recognized by Anna University, Chennai to offer Ph.D. programme. The department has ten well\u2011equipped laboratories and four Centre of Excellence, covering a wide range of areas in the field of EE. Some of the best teaching practices include peer to peer learning, use of ICT tools, flipped classroom and project-based learning. A total of 26 faculties serves the department including 16 Ph.D. holders. MoUs with leading industries such as ABB, Virtusa, EKKI are some of the highlights of the department. Some of our top recruiters are Schneider Electric, L&T, VVDN, Tech Mahindra and Ivymobility and TESSOLVE.",
        "The Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering extends its focus beyond innovation to shaping future engineers in alignment with India's National Education Policy. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy, into the curriculum, the department ensures that students not only grasp theoretical concepts but also engage with practical applications. This approach not only fosters a deep understanding of electrical engineering but also prepares students to address contemporary challenges. In this educational journey, our leadership steers not only academic excellence but also the application of knowledge to build a brighter, more sustainable India.",
